# Invite-Robotics
This repository contains the integration of the CSDA10F dual-arm Motoman Robot with two Robotiq grippers and custom sensors with ROS framework. Aiming to develop robotics applications at Invite GmbH Research Center.

For further information please see the repository [Wiki](https://github.com/Danfoa/invite-robotics/wiki).

## Release notes
### v0.1.3  - _Alpha release_
* New inverse kinematics solver ([Track_IK](https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik)) implemented for `arm_left` and `arm_right` move groups; this solver impoves heavily the planning behaviour near singulatiry points and joint limits, plus a general increase in robustness and speed - new dependency added: `trac_ik_kinematics_plugin` (to package `invite_motoman_moveit_config`)
* New tutorial added: [Simulation Scene Objects](https://github.com/Danfoa/invite-robotics/wiki/Tutorial---Simulation-Scene-Objects); Default scene objects were pre configured for easy loading and using, see tutorial for instructions of use. 
* New tutorial added: [Modify Robot Grippers](https://github.com/Danfoa/invite-robotics/wiki/Tutorial---Modify-Robot-Grippers); With this tutorial the grippers configuration was changed (i.g. the TCP was moved)

## About The Project
This is a non-profit/collaborative project between the National University of Colombia and Invite GmbH research center, that intends to allow Invite to develope more complex/cooler task without them facing alone the already challenging ROS learning curve. In order to achieve this we are trying to set-up most required robot configurations and write/migrate examples and tutorials of common task with the CSDA10F robot.
