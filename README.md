# Invite-Robotics
This repository contains the integration of the [CSDA10F dual-arm Motoman Robot](https://www.yaskawa.eu.com/uk/products/robotic/motoman-robots/productdetail/product/csda10f/) with two [2-figer adaptive Robotiq grippers](https://robotiq.com/support/2-finger-adaptive-robot-gripper) and custom sensors with ROS framework. Aiming to develop robotics applications at Invite GmbH Research Center.

## About The Project
This is a non-profit/collaborative project between the National University of Colombia and Invite GmbH research center, that intends to allow Invite to develope more complex/cooler task without them facing alone the already challenging ROS learning curve. In order to achieve this we are trying to set-up most required robot configurations and write/migrate examples and tutorials of common task with the CSDA10F robot.
