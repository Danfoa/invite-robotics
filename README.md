# Invite-Robotics
This repository contains the integration of the CSDA10F dual-arm Motoman Robot with two Robotiq grippers and custom sensors with ROS framework. Aiming to develop robotics applications at Invite GmbH Research Center.

## About The Project
This is a non-profit/collaborative project between the National University of Colombia and Invite GmbH research center, that intends to allow Invite to develope more complex/cooler task without them facing alone the already challenging ROS learning curve. In order to achieve this we are trying to set-up most required robot configurations and write/migrate examples and tutorials of common task with the CSDA10F robot.
